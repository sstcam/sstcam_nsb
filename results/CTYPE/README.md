ASTRI DRACO With following parameters:

starttime = Time('2019-05-08T23:37:54.72806')
loc = EarthLocation.from_geodetic(lon=14.974609, lat=37.693267, height=1750*u.m) #ASTRI Site Coordinates                                                                                                   
fov = 10 degrees
obsalt = 73.74*u.deg
obsaz = 0.465*u.deg

This folder contains various iterations of fov maps with the brightest five stars highlighted. What changes is the presence of a 2 hour UTC time correction and the WCS CTYPE for each image.
